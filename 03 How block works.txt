What is hash? id for block
Where is the data stored? in blocks
How is data stored? by hashing with nonce
What is nonce? no. combined with data to produce hash
Every block has difficulty: 
more difficulty -> more big predefined condition
Small change in data -> Block modified -> changes nonce

	        	Hashing
transaction data  	-----> hash	//block in blockchain
(name,$ etc)
____________________________________________
Block: #1

Nonce: 3885

transaction Data:  Angela Owes Jack 10$

Prev: 00000000000000000000

Hash:000dfsf09sd8f0s90f8s0s

How to add block to blockchain?  predefined condition
				for ex hash has to start with 3 0s	//easy difficulty

how to achieve condition?
1) manually keep adding data until condition matches	(HECTIC)
2) Modify the nonce
	for ex nonce = 1 => produces hash with 4 0s (HECTIC)
		     = 2 => 	.......and So on

3)  BRUTE FORCE THE nonce by COMPUTER  
	For the above: takes 0.1 second for computer
	Nonce: 3885 is answer nonce to encode the above data
 
 -> MINE

OUTPUT:
Block becomes valid -> turns green	//blockchain requirement satisfied
