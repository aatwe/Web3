What are decentralized apps? get our apps to do things based on code in blockchain
Backbone of Web3.0
DECENTRALIZED = TRUSTLESS
How it changes business? Basically will help raise funding earlier
Build startup ---> Raise VC Funding ----> IPO + Cashout


Web3.0
Build startup ---> Release tokens to VC/public ---->	Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
		Sell tokens that enable people	Replace board of directors(token holders)
		to use & interact technology		//Special token = Governance token
		Allow user to contri to roadmap	Allows to vote what DApp should do in future




Everybody's incentive are alligned : if application does well ---> token price goes up ---> company has to do valuable things/make good decisions


Ex of Decentralized App : Filecoin :  Hosted across millions of computers
	//Like dropbox

Filecoin : ICO ; Initial Coin Offering oublic buys their coins	: raise huge money


What advantages? more incentive to work, no need to trust, honest work, power in hands of people
Do you have to give away identity? no ---> can use pseudonym


GET RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT YOU DO, INSTEAD OF WHAT YOU ARE
Age wont matter, race wont matter
Just have to produce valuable things
