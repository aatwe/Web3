What is done in distributed blockchain?
Blockchain distributed on multiple computers
	Why distribute? to maintain integrity of data
	There is no need to trust someone	for ex Bank / Paypal to make sure all transactions are correct

Transaction instead encoded by Blockchain

Does it matter who stores the copy of block chain? NO , 

All participant has to agree what is on the ledger

How to agree?

PeerA Block chain data = Peer B Block chain data = Peer C Block chain data	//Why? identical hash

Peer A : 	Block 1 --->  Block 2 ---> Block 3	BC1	//Computer 1

Peer B :    Block 1 ---> Block  2 ---> Block 3	BC2	//Computer 2

Peer C :    Block 1 ---> Block  2 ---> Block 3	BC3	//Computer 3

If Peer A decides to be cheeky and change blockchain data
   Next blocks invalidate

	What if he remines all other blocks?
		They wont match with other block chain
	
B1!= BC2 = BC3
Player A is bad player, their hash dont match with other's
