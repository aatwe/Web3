IC Aggregates compute capacity of large no. of independent data centres
	Combine data centres around the world  how? Internet Computer protocol	
		Combine into? Large single Decentralized world computer

		
Decentralized World Computer -----> organized into ----> Cannister smart chains
						//note cannister = cans
What is inside a can?
store program + program state 	//using web assembly module + memory page flash memory model

What do these cannister do? Basically: 
NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT DATABASE --> program never gets killed
	Run processes, execute code, store data for programs
	Manage memory :  
	Each cannister acts like code sandbox / container/ docker
		Basically program state is preserved
	Cannister seems to run forever
	Dev perspective: You run a program in cannister => program never gets killed
	data can be kept in variables, all variables hold on to their state

NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT DATABASE

How do we communicate with cannisters? HTTPS Requests


What do dev have to do?
1) write code that compiles correctly on user Hardware using Web Assembly
2) Just worry about logic
What languages dev can use?
Rust , motoko


How many cannister running rn?30k
Many applications are built on internet computer
Decentralized Reddit / tiktok etc

How user interaction changes?
For ex Cancan Decentralized Tiktok : For ex you like a new video -> if video is viral --> reward first 20 people who liked with can can tokens			
									get virtual products / sponser gifts etc
