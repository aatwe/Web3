CRYPTOGRAPHY PRINCIPLE : GOING FORWARDS is quick and EZ to calculate
			GOING BACKWARDS almost impossible using current computational

Blockchain = ledger

a ledger = record : notes down transactions

Jack -> Helena : 10 $
Angela -> Helena : 5 $


What is the problem with normal ledger?
all 3 have to agree, which transactions will be noted down : AGREEMENT
Trust the ledger holding person, that they wont modify	 : TRUST
						   DATA TAMPERING



Solution: Make history of transaction Immutable i.e LOCK IT FOREVER
	How to secure ledger?

1)
	encryption? not v secure, cipher can be decrypted (encryption works both ways)

For ex Caeser Cypher (shift)
	ez to figure out just know the shift no.

               encrypt
Message --------> Cipher

2) Hashing	
     Msg	   Hash
Ex. 29 x2 = 58	
 but find factor of 58? difficult
		//Output: has same no. of characters	//One way
ex SHA 256	//you can type an entire book and  -> it will generate a hash

	Hashing
Message ----------> Hash Code

3) BitCoin Ledger
	        Hashing
transaction data -----> hash
